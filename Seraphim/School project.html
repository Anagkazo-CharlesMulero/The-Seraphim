<p>It is at God's heart to have every man saved,</br> and that is why God has made salvation to be a free gift from Him through His son Jesus Christ</br>
    so that whoever is willing should affordably(freely) receive this free gift.</br>
    It is though, not enough to just receive salvation, 
     but it is also God's desire to see every saved person grow in the knowldge and wisdom of His will. </br>
